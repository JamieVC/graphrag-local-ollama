are preliminary based on current expectations, and are subject to change without notice. Resnet50 (Meteor Lake)
• Peak TOPS ( pTOPS ) = peak theoretical max performance 
pTOPS = max frequency * (MAC / clock) * 2
NPU is 11 pTOPS
• Effective TOPS ( eTOPS ) = real performance on a given AI workload (the 
efficiency of pTOPS )
eTOP S= (fps * each frame GOPs )/1000 
NPU 8.2 eTOPS = (1000 * 8.216 ) / 1000
• We use ResNet50: a common network + a good mix of a memory & compute 
bound network.  Is it Perfect? -> No, but it’s better than pTOPS as eTOPS
shows real workload measured across many HW configsInput 224x224 Output (frame)Workload
(MACs operations on NPU)
•Operations per frame: 
constant value per 
network, for Resnet50 
it’s 8.216 GOPs
One multiply -accumulate is two operations4
